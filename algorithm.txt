1. Java program to multiply given number by using bitwise operators.

  a) Let a,b be two integrers
  b) While b greater than 0,
      i.   check if b is odd using AND operator
      ii.  if odd, add a to variable 'result'
      iii. multiply a by 2 using left shift operator
      iv.  divide b by 2 using right shift operator
  c) Print 'result'
  
2. Java program to check if a given bit position is set to one or not.
  
  a) Input an integer and position from user
  b) Calculate the binary right shift of the integer to get to the given position
  c) If the bit is equal to one, print 'set to one' else 'set to zero'

3. Java program to count hte numbert of bits set to 1.

  a) Input an integer fron the user
  b) Loop through all the bits in the integer using right shift operator
  c) Check if the bit is equal to 1 using AND operator
  d) Increment 'count' by 1 if the bit is 1
  e) Print 'count' after exiting from the loop

4. Java program to illustrate the use of various bitwise operators

  a) Let a,b as two integers
  b) Calculate a&b, store it in 'and' and print 'and'
  c) Calculate a|b, store it in 'or' and print 'or'
  d) Calculate a^b, store it in 'xor' and print 'xor'
  e) Calculate ~a,~b  and print the values
  f) Calculate a<<b, store it in 'left' and print 'left'
  g) Calculate a>>b, store it in 'right' and print 'right'
  h) Calculate a>>>b, store it in 'zero' and print 'zero'
  
5. Java program to swap the contents of 2 numbers using bitwise XOR operation

  a) Let a,b as two integers
  b) Calculate a^b and store in a
  c) Calculate a^b and store in b
  d) Again, calculate a^b and store in a
  e) Print a and b
